This directory houses the GitHub Action
for easily running [Bento](https://github.com/returntocorp/bento) on your GitHub projects
to find bugs in open pull requests.

The Action reviews pull requests whenever a new commit is added to them.
It reports as failed if there's any new bugs that first appeared in that pull request.

## Usage

To check all pull requests, add the following file at `.github/workflows/bento.yml`:

```yaml
name: Bento
on: [pull_request]
jobs:
  bento:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Bento checks
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v1
      - name: Bento checks
        id: bento
        uses: returntocorp/bento-action@v1
        with:
          acceptTermsWithEmail: <add your email here>
```

To use Bento, you must accept [our Terms of Service & Privacy Policy](https://bento.dev/privacy)
by specifying your email address.
This email will be used to provide support and share product updates
â€” you can unsubscribe at any time.

## Contributing
